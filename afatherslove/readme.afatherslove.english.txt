------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This mod requires BG2EE or EET.

The "A Father's Love" mod's main purpose is to provide a motivation to go to Spellhold without having to work for the lesser of two evils.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Main Component: The PC is hired to bring back Irenicus to face justice
------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: If "The Cost Of One Girl's Soul" mod is installed, the item that starts that quest will be moved to the Genie in the Plane of Air to allow the PC time to learn what happened and the significance of the item.  You will also have the in-game choice of which method to use to help Skie during the initial phase of the quest.  Either one will end the PC's exile and allow for the continuation of the main quest.  If you install CoOGs and then throw away its version of the dagger, the exile will resolve itself in time anyway, but there will be consequences.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLANNED FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Incorporate the completed Framed Again quest mod
* Write quest to have Entar put pressure on the Cowled Wizards to return Irenicus for justice

COMPATIBILITY NOTES

There are no known compatability issues at this time

INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation using Project Infinity (https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/comment/1145416/#Comment_1145416) will ensure this and other mods are installed in the correct order.

NOTE: If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting a new version. To do this, uninstall all previously installed components and delete the mod folder and executables. 

When installing or uninstalling, do not close the DOS window by clicking on the X button! Instead, press the Enter key when instructed to do so.

General (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux)

Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game's main directory. 

Windows
On successful extraction, there should be a framedagain folder and a setup-framedagain.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-framedagain.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
Run setup-framedagain.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.

Mac OS X
The mod is packaged and installed with WeiDU. To install, extract the mod archive, then copy of the contents of the folder into your game folder (the folder which contains the CHITIN.KEY file). If properly extracted, you should have a "framedagain" folder, setup-framedagain, and setup-framedagain.command in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-framedagain.command and follow the instructions on screen.

Linux
Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal and cd to your EET installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already run it once in the same directory. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safest bet.
Run WeInstall framedagain in your game folder to install the mod. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. 

If you have installation problems or encounter any bugs, please post your bug report in the forum thread: https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/???/.
